**Communicating public health data with Shiny: West Nile virus risk, school vaccination rates, health equity, and more**
*RStudio Conference, January 28, 2020*

The Cook County Department of Public Health (CCDPH) is a local health department that serves 2.5 million residents in the suburbs surrounding Chicago. The Communicable Disease Unit at CCDPH tracks around 15,000 cases of over sixty infectious diseases and conditions each year. We use this data to better understand infectious disease burden in our community, detect outbreaks, and prevent further infections. We also want to make accessing this health data more flexible and user-friendly for the public as well as our internal staff. Over the past two years, we have created a [suite of Shiny apps] (https://ccdphcd.shinyapps.io/home/) that allow users to explore aggregated case data, compare infectious disease rates in our county through a health equity lens, examine school vaccination trends and find and interpret their schoolâ€™s vaccination rates, and track local flu and West Nile virus seasons as they develop.
